# Hi, I'm mel chanatan! 👋

I'm a student, aspiring software engineer, web/app developer, and mediocre UI/UX designer. 
🌟 Current project(s): Toyota Campus Challenge 2023, Lotus's HYPER HACK

### A bit about me
- I love building projects with React and Next JS. Currently learning Rust and catching up on Software architecture
- I enjoy making and buying aesthetically pleasing things 🌟 
- My hobbies includes drawing, anime, cooking🍳 and looking at custom keyboards on facebook groups (kinda sad but true, desperately need to make money to buy more)
- Currently reminding myself to document my code and write meaningful commit messages (reminding meself not to be lazy)
