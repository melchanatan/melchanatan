# Hi, I'm Mel Chanatan! ðŸ‘‹
> A product engineer whoâ€™s obsessed with great user experiences.

## A bit about me
-   I love building things that are both **useful** and **a joy to use**.
-   UX/UI design and illustration are my creative outlets.
-   I'm a sucker for aesthetically pleasing objects â€” think **art toys** and **custom keyboards** ðŸŒŸ
-   Iâ€™m also into **observability** â€” I love tracking how users interact with my products to make them better.
